Ecosystem mindset is key to competitiveness but note that the competition is ecosystem vs ecosystem and not company vs company
There are three types of ecosystems 1) Business 2) Innovation 3) Platform, we need to find position in an ecosystem that creates value and to create value we need to use the right mindset
Companies in ecosystems create significant value, companies with traditional mindsets using old business models do not
One should invest in those assets and capabilities that are rare, valuable, and hard for competitors to imitate
For an organization which is ready for human-machine collaboration 1) leadership is critical 2) building trust in artificial intelligence systems and insights 3) reskilling the workforce to ensure complementarity and 4) address employee's concerns,
Ability to mimic human intelligence is what makes artificial intelligence applications useful
It is not possible to create value without the right mindset
The world now is interdependent
Old hierarchy-based business models do not work (even if the business schools are still teaching them)
